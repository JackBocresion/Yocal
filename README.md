# Yocal

Welcome to Yocal! Yocal is a social media calendar app for scheduling stuff with friends. This is a big work in progress, little is finished and alot of stuff is old code. 

## Getting Started:

1 - clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/JackBocresion/Yocal.git` <br />
2 - cd into both the `server` and `client` directories. These are where both the server and client live.  <br />
3 - run `npm start` in both directories.

## Making Changes:

### Server

1 - cd into the src directory <br />
2 - change away!

### Client

1 - nothing special here, just change away!
